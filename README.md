# DerDieDas
A gamified way of practicing German noun genders.
Mostly just a project for me to learn ReactNative and App development from initialitation through to releasing in app stores.

## Building the app
Follow the steps from ReactNative to get your environment ready: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup.
```
yarn add --immutable
yarn run start ios/android
```
